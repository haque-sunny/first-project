            <h3><span class="colored-Q">What</span> and <span class="colored-Q">who</span> am I <span
                    class="colored-Q">?</span></h3>
            <p>first of all I am a human being. an wierd one at that. I can feel pain,I get angry ,I get upset ,tensed
                ,and I have a name! pretty normal stuff right? yeah, all this is pretty normal so far but the abnormal
                thing with me is I am not afraid!! I generally don't fear anything that can or might hurt me or
                possibly kill me. I don't fear anything that has the potential to kill me. and I don't cry alot. okay I
                do but, but thats only when something injustice happens to me. I never cry simply because I'm hurt or
                something. oh, and I tend to smile, lough, and make jokes to make everyone else laugh in a tough
                situation... but the thing is, everything I do just seems to make me spend money and I want money!, I
                don't need it, I just want it. that's all. </p>

            <h2>Dream</h2>
            <h3>maybe, idont know</h3>
            <p>You know, staying busy is not thaat bad. It gives the thrill of live. If your busy that means you are
                doint something meaningfull or atleast something that matters more than other things. And thats not that
                bad.and if you earn something from doing that than heckk it's it's a win-win situation. so ultimately ,i
                think my dream is to become someone who doesn't need to explain something to others to do something that
                holds meaning! i guess. and now im just writting because i need the website to look symmetrical and
                there needs to be more writtingto do that.:)</p>
