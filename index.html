    <p>first of all I am a human being. an wierd one at that. I can feel pain,I get angry ,I get upset ,tensed ,and I have a name! pretty normal stuff right? yeah, all this is pretty normal so far but the abnormal thing with me is I am not affraid!! I generally don't fear anything that can or might hurt me or possibly kill me. I don't fear anything that has the potential to kill me. and I don't cry alot. okay I do but, but thats only whene something injustice happens to me. I never cry simply because I'm hurt or something. oh, and I tend to smile, lough, and make jokes to make everyone else lough in a tough situation... </p>
